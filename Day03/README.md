### Virtual Machine (VM)
Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications in an isolated environment. Managed by a hypervisor on a host machine, VMs allow multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on one physical server, improving resource efficiency, security, and testing.

### Server 
A server is a powerful computer, system, or software program that manages, stores, and distributes data, applications, and resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

### Virtualization
Virtualization uses software (hypervisors) to create simulated, virtual versions of physical IT resources—servers, storage, networks, and applications—allowing multiple, independent, and secure systems to run on a single physical machine.

### API 
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows two different software programs to communicate with each other and exchange data or functionality.

### CLI
A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface used to interact with operating systems and software by typing commands into a terminal or console.
