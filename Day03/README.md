### Virtual Machine (VM)
Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications in an isolated environment. Managed by a hypervisor on a host machine, VMs allow multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on one physical server, improving resource efficiency, security, and testing.
